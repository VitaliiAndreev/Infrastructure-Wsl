rem Explorer-double-click launcher for scripts/run-lint.sh (this
rem repo's local entry). The local .sh transitively exec's
rem Common-Automation's canonical runner with COMMON_AUTOMATION_TARGET_REPO set, so
rem the chain is local.bat -> local.sh -> shared engine - one entry
rem point per layer, no shortcutting.
rem
rem _find-bash.bat from Common-Automation resolves Git Bash robustly and
rem sets %BASH%; reused rather than duplicated.
rem
rem Common-Automation is expected as a sibling checkout under the same
rem parent directory (c:\a_Code\Common-Automation alongside this repo).

rem COMMON_AUTOMATION_NO_PAUSE silences the shared engine's EXIT trap pause;
rem this .bat holds the window itself with the `pause` below so
rem Explorer-click users can read the output.
